## Required File

- `alarm_sound.mp3` - A gentle but audible alarm sound

## How to Add

1. Download or create an alarm sound MP3 file
2. Name it `alarm_sound.mp3`
3. Place it in this folder (`assets/audio/`)

## Recommended Sounds

For a sleep reminder app, consider using:

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have an audio file yet, you can:

1. Download any MP3 file
2. Rename it to `alarm_sound.mp3`
3. Place it here

The alarm will still work with vibration even without the audio file.
